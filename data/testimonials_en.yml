    We decided to collaborate with Defacto early in 2016 and start implementing our digital learning environment. Later that year, we also started using the Quality Portfolio for nurses. The implementation period was intense, but very constructive and insightful due to Defacto's guidance. The skills, high quality engagement and helpfulness of the consultants have lead us to develop our own concept of learning.

    As a study centre, we have been proposed to think about a systematic way to implement the Quality Portfolio that fits our necessity to safeguard and monitor the competencies of our employees.

    Right now, we are in the middle of the implementation process, because we have chosen to do this with one focus group at a time. The first impressions are very positive, the employees are pleased with the user experience of the Quality Portfolio. What is more, the implementation of Quality Portfolio has increased accountability of our administrative, lawmaking and certification departments.
